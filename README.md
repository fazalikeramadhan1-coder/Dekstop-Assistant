# Dekstop-Assistant
A simple Windows desktop assistant built using pure WinAPI and C++.  This application creates a small always-on-top window that acts as a basic assistant. Users can type commands and receive predefined responses.  This project is intended as a foundation for building more advanced desktop assistants.
